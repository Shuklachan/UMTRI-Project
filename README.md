# UMTRI-Project
This is the work which I am carrying out with [University of Michigan Transportaiton Research Institute, Ann Arbor](http://www.umtri.umich.edu).

With the data provided by a leading ride sharing company in Asia, we are analyzing the idling behaviours of drivers

In our study, we are using Machine Leanring, Dynamic Programming, Reinforcement Learning, Statistics and Natural Language Processing to get deeper insight into the data

We are also working towards building a simulator for the idling behaviour of the driver
